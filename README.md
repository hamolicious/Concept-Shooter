# Concept-Shooter
One of those Corona-virus quarantine projects, a little concept game that I may keep working on!

To use this script use the following commands:
```
pip install pygame

git clone <URL>
cd <REPO NAME>
python main.py
```

If you do not want to install any packages, you can also use repl.it to run PyGame scripts!

Please create issues to tell me what you like/don't like about this project.
If I missed anything please create an issue too!
